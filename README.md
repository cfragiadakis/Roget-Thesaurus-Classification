# Roget's Thesaurus Classification


In this project, we will analyze the [Roget's Thesaurus](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10681/old/20040627-10681-h-body-pos.htm#180.1) lexicon.
Through web scraping, we access Roget's comprehensive collection of words and their associations. We will implement word embeddings for the word entries of the lexicon, aiming to achieve two objectives:
* Explore if there is a clustering method that can produce similar hierarchies as Roget's.
* Develop the best classification method, wherein the model's task is to discern a word's correct Class or Section/Division within Roget's categorization.
