# Roget's Thesaurus Classification

3rd Assignment for Applied Machine Learning 2024 (DMST, AUEB)

You can find the description of the assignment [here:](https://github.com/cfragiadakis/Roget-s-Thesaurus-Classification/blob/main/third_assignment.ipynb) 

On this project, we will download the lexicon of [Roget](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10681/old/20040627-10681-h-body-pos.htm#180.1) using web scraping. After that, we will implement word embeddings for the word entries, and we will use them to create two machine learning models that receive a word as input, and predict the class or the section/division of the word.
